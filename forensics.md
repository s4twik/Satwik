I didn't knew what header file was so i googled it and found out it's the first line of the hex file of the bmp file
so to run the bmp file i had to edit the header file, so i googled what the header file of the bmp file should look like
and accordingly the changes in offset `0A` and `0E` i didn't understand what to do in `0A` so i put it as 0 and `0E` to 40 in hex for which is 0028

i coldn't figure out the problem, then it clicked that the aspect ratio is a bit off
so i googled what offset are meant for the aspect ratio of the file 
i kept changing the height little by little and after a few attempts i got the flag

#### Typical Flag Transfer Protocol
Started by downloading the file, saw it was a pcapng file
I had no clue what that is so i googled what that is, read a bit about. Didn't understand anything
so I googled how to run it, it gave me a software called `Wireshark`. Downloaded it via terminal following : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-and-use-wireshark-on-ubuntu-linux/
uploaded the file

I see something called `TFTP Protocol` and reaslised it was the name of the file i just ran. I take it as a clue and google `TFTP Protocol`
it's a file transfer function which doesn't require authentication.
I export all the Networks w/tftp protocol to a folder
i get a 3 bmp files and 2 text files. I go through one of the file. It's Encryted so i run it through dcode.fr
it was encrypted in ROT13 format

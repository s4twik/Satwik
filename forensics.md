I didn't knew what header file was so i googled it and found out it's the first line of the hex file of the bmp file
so to run the bmp file i had to edit the header file, so i googled what the header file of the bmp file should look like
and accordingly the changes in offset `0A` and `0E` i didn't understand what to do in `0A` so i put it as 0 and `0E` to 40 in hex for which is 0028

i coldn't figure out the problem, then it clicked that the aspect ratio is a bit off
so i googled what offset are meant for the aspect ratio of the file 
i kept changing the height little by little and after a few attempts i got the flag

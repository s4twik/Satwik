i download the code, i run it using the command given on the site
it give me options. it's asking me for API token, i google it! nothing useful for this scenario
I start reading the code
i find many different things which i didn't know about in C syntax mainly.
i google them and get solutions to them
then i find some thing that seemed like a syntax error but at the end it is working.

so i google what does it mean
so it meant that if i put format specifier as an input i'll get a value
so i put %s as in an put to put string value

uhmmm! okay
i try it with different format specifier!
i am getting random values!
got no clue!
so i check out one of the writeups available!(i was correct till this point)
i put a lot `%x` to get a lot of garbage value
